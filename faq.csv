Q001,Bookkeeping,How do I record revenue from annual subscriptions collected upfront?,"A SaaS company should recognize subscription revenue over the service period rather than upfront, because under ASC 606 revenue must align with when the service is delivered rather than when cash is collected, ensuring the income statement accurately reflects performance and preventing an early spike in earnings that could mislead stakeholders; therefore the appropriate entry at receipt is Dr Cash / Cr Deferred Revenue, followed by monthly Dr Deferred Revenue / Cr Subscription Revenue to release one-twelfth of the amount, while tax rules under IRC §451 may also permit limited deferral of prepaid income; however, nuances in contract terms or tax elections can alter treatment, so management should consult a CPA for tailored guidance.",Done,Reference Law: FASB ASC 606-10-25-1 et seq.; IRC §451(c),For SaaS Startup 
Q002,Bookkeeping,Should I recognize deferred revenue for prepaid SaaS contracts?,"Prepaid SaaS contracts require recognizing a deferred-revenue liability at receipt because GAAP treats advance payments as an obligation to deliver future services, so Dr Cash / Cr Deferred Revenue is booked and revenue is subsequently recognized over time as performance obligations are satisfied, which preserves the matching principle and prevents income overstatement; ignoring deferral could misstate both current liabilities and earnings, and although the IRS may tax the income immediately, certain advance-payment deferrals are allowed by election, making professional advice essential.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606-10-55-47 through 55-49; IRC §451; Rev. Proc. 2004-34,For SaaS Startup 
Q003,Bookkeeping,How do I book Stripe transaction fees?,"Stripe fees should be recorded as an expense separate from gross revenue—book Dr Cash (net deposit), Dr Merchant Fees Expense (Stripe fee), and Cr Sales Revenue (gross charge)—because GAAP requires revenue to be reported gross and fees shown as a selling expense, which yields an accurate gross-margin presentation and transparent cost of processing; netting fees against revenue would understate both sales and expenses, distorting KPIs, so businesses should follow this gross-up approach in the general ledger.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606 (gross vs. net considerations) and ASC 340-10-25-3 (selling costs),For SaaS Startup 
Q004,Bookkeeping,What's the correct journal entry when a customer pays via ACH but Stripe reports it 2 days later?,"When a customer pays via ACH but Stripe remits funds two days later, recognize revenue and a clearing receivable on the payment date by booking Dr Stripe Receivable / Cr Revenue, then, upon Stripe’s deposit, Dr Cash, Dr Merchant Fees, and Cr Stripe Receivable, Cr Merchant Fee Payable; this two-step treatment respects accrual accounting by matching revenue to when control transfers while reflecting the intermediary’s settlement cycle, and it keeps cash, receivables, and fee expense properly stated.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606-10-25-30 (control transfer) and ASC 310 (receivables),For SaaS Startup 
Q005,Bookkeeping,How do I account for a refund issued to a customer mid-subscription?,"A mid-subscription refund should be recorded by reversing previously recognized revenue for the unused portion and returning cash to the customer—Dr Sales Returns and Allowances (contra-revenue) and Cr Cash or Accounts Payable—because GAAP requires revenue to reflect amounts the company expects to be entitled to, and issuing a refund indicates the original estimate changed; this ensures net revenue and refund liability are presented fairly.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606-10-32-10 through 32-14 (variable consideration and refunds),For SaaS Startup 
Q006,Bookkeeping,What’s the journal entry for monthly AWS hosting costs paid by credit card?,"Monthly AWS hosting paid by credit card should be expensed when incurred via Dr Hosting Expense and Cr Credit Card Payable, with subsequent payment Dr Credit Card Payable / Cr Cash, because hosting is a period cost that provides immediate benefit, and using the payable account respects accrual timing while keeping credit-card balances traceable.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 720-15 (general expenses),For SaaS Startup 
Q007,Bookkeeping,How do I record Google Ads expenses that are automatically charged each month?,Automatically charged Google Ads should be recognized as advertising expense at the time the ads run—Dr Advertising Expense / Cr Credit Card Payable—since they create current-period benefits and are ordinary business costs; this classification also supports proper tracking for tax deduction under ordinary and necessary business-expense rules.,Done,Reference Law: ASC 720-35; IRC §162(a),For SaaS Startup 
Q008,Bookkeeping,Should I capitalize or expense software development costs?,"Software-development costs should generally be expensed as incurred during research or preliminary stages, but once technological feasibility (for external software) or the application development stage (for internal-use software) is reached, qualifying costs may be capitalized and amortized, so record Dr Software Intangible Asset / Cr Cash or Payables for capitalizable portions; this dual approach aligns with GAAP’s careful distinction between R&D costs and capitalizable intangibles.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 730 (R&D) and ASC 350-40 (internal-use software),For SaaS Startup 
Q009,Bookkeeping,How do I recognize revenue if our product includes both software and onboarding services?,"When a contract bundles software access and onboarding services, allocate the transaction price between the distinct performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices, then recognize software revenue ratably and onboarding revenue upon completion, achieved via Dr Deferred Revenue / Cr Revenue entries as each component is satisfied, thereby preventing front-loading or double-counting revenue.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606-10-32-28 (allocation) and 606-10-25-23 (distinct goods/services),For SaaS Startup 
Q010,Bookkeeping,How should I record venture capital investment proceeds received in our bank account?,"Venture-capital cash received should be recorded as equity: Dr Cash / Cr Common Stock (par) and Cr Additional Paid-In Capital for the excess, because invested funds are not income but owner capital, ensuring liabilities and revenue are not overstated and equity accurately reflects ownership contributions.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 505-10-45 (equity),For SaaS Startup 
Q011,Bookkeeping,What entry do I make when issuing SAFEs to investors?,"A SAFE usually represents an equity-classified instrument absent redemption features, so record Dr Cash / Cr SAFE Equity while disclosing its potential conversion, because there is typically no repayment obligation; if terms include put features or debt-like traits classification may differ, necessitating professional review.",Done,"Reference Law: ASC 480-10-25 and AICPA TQA Section 1, Question 6",For SaaS Startup 
Q012,Bookkeeping,How do I record equity-based compensation (stock options)?,"Stock-option grants are expensed at fair value over the vesting period, so each month book Dr Compensation Expense / Cr Additional Paid-In Capital, because GAAP views equity instruments issued for services as compensation even without cash outlay, ensuring labor costs are fully reflected in earnings.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 718-10-30,For SaaS Startup 
Q013,Bookkeeping,How should I account for a contractor invoice that hasn’t been paid yet?,"An unpaid contractor invoice should be accrued: Dr Contractor Expense / Cr Accounts Payable on the service date, then relieved upon payment, because expenses must be recognized when incurred regardless of payment timing, preserving expense matching and liability completeness.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 705-20 (services received) and ASC 405-20 (AP),For SaaS Startup 
Q014,Bookkeeping,What’s the difference in journal entries between cash and accrual basis for us?,"Under cash basis you record entries only when cash moves, whereas accrual basis records revenues when earned and expenses when incurred, so the same transaction might hit revenue immediately under accrual but be delayed under cash; choose based on GAAP requirements and tax eligibility, noting that accrual provides a clearer performance picture.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 105 (GAAP hierarchy) and IRC §448 (cash-method limitations),For SaaS Startup 
Q015,Bookkeeping,How do I book a payment for annual liability insurance coverage?,"Annual liability-insurance premiums paid upfront should be capitalized as Prepaid Insurance (asset) and amortized monthly by Dr Insurance Expense / Cr Prepaid Insurance, aligning cost with the coverage period instead of overstating one month’s expenses.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 720-20-25,For SaaS Startup 
Q016,Bookkeeping,What’s the proper entry for a monthly Zoom subscription?,"A monthly Zoom subscription is typically immaterial in duration, so expense it as incurred—Dr Software Subscription Expense / Cr Credit Card Payable—simplifying bookkeeping while correctly hitting profit and loss in the month of use.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 720-15,For SaaS Startup 
Q017,Bookkeeping,How do I record revenue that includes sales tax in certain states?,"When revenue includes sales tax, record Dr Cash for the gross amount, Cr Sales Revenue for the net, and Cr Sales Tax Payable for the tax portion, because sales tax is a liability you collect on behalf of states, not revenue, preventing overstatement of earnings.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606-10-32-2 (principal vs. agent) and state tax regs,For SaaS Startup 
Q018,Bookkeeping,Should I accrue expenses for unpaid invoices at month-end?,"Accruing unpaid vendor invoices at month-end requires estimating and recording Dr Expense / Cr Accrued Liability to capture incurred costs in the proper period, avoiding understated expenses and overstated profit.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 450-20-25 (accruals),For SaaS Startup 
Q019,Bookkeeping,How do I treat expenses reimbursed by employees (e.g. via Expensify)?,"Employee-reimbursed expenses should be booked Dr Expense / Cr Employee Reimbursements Payable upon submission, then Dr Employee Reimbursements Payable / Cr Cash when paid, ensuring the expense hits the income statement while the payable tracks settlement.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 710-10,For SaaS Startup

Q021,Bookkeeping,How do I handle foreign currency transactions in our QuickBooks account?,"Foreign-currency transactions in QuickBooks should be recorded at the functional-currency equivalent on transaction date and remeasured at period-end, booking exchange gains/losses to Other Income, ensuring assets and liabilities reflect current FX rates and variances reach earnings.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 830-20,For SaaS Startup 
Q022,Bookkeeping,How should I book R&D tax credits in our books?,"R&D payroll tax credits earned should reduce income-tax expense (or payroll taxes if elected) via Dr Tax Receivable / Cr Income Tax Benefit, then offset against the liability when applied, preventing double counting and correctly presenting the credit as a tax benefit rather than revenue.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §41; ASC 740-10-25-31,For SaaS Startup

Q029,Bookkeeping,"How do I track and record intercompany charges (e.g., if we have a Delaware C-corp and a foreign parent)?","Intercompany charges should be booked symmetrically—charging entity: Dr Due from Subsidiary / Cr Intercompany Revenue; receiving entity: Dr Expense / Cr Due to Parent—then eliminated in consolidation, preventing double counting and ensuring group statements show only external transactions.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 810-10-45-1,For SaaS Startup 
Q030,Bookkeeping,How should I record discounts or promotional credits offered to customers?,"Customer discounts or promotional credits reduce revenue, so record Dr Sales Discounts and Allowances (contra-revenue) and Cr Accounts Receivable or Cash, ensuring net sales reflect actual consideration expected and preventing inflated top-line figures.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606-10-32-25 through 32-29,For SaaS Startup 
Q031,Tax,How should I handle sales tax for our SaaS product in different states?,"Sales tax on a SaaS product must be collected in any state where the company has nexus and the state taxes remotely delivered software, so you should check each jurisdiction’s rules, register where required, and charge customers the correct rate, because sales tax is generally a destination-based levy and many states now treat cloud software as taxable tangible personal property or a digital good; applying the correct rate prevents under-collection penalties and interest while preserving customer trust, and most businesses rely on tax-automation software to manage jurisdiction-level rates and exemptions, although final responsibility rests with the seller—consult a CPA or SALT specialist to confirm obligations in each state. However, specifics can change rapidly, so professional guidance is advised.",Done,"Reference Law: Wayfair v. South Dakota (U.S. Supreme Court 2018); state statutes such as Cal. Rev. & Tax Code §6010.9, N.Y. Tax Law §1105(a); Tex. Tax Code §151.0101; various economic-nexus statutes.",For SaaS Startup 
Q032,Tax,"Is our SaaS product taxable in California, New York, or Texas?","California and New York generally tax remotely accessed SaaS, whereas Texas exempts “pure” cloud subscriptions but taxes electronically transferred software, so SaaS access fees to California or New York customers are taxable while Texas may be exempt depending on downloadability and usage rights; recognizing this distinction ensures proper tax collection and avoids state audits, and regular monitoring of each state’s guidance is essential because interpretations evolve. Seek state-specific updates annually.",Done,Reference Law: Cal. CDTFA Special Notice L-698; N.Y. TSB-M-11(16)S; Tex. Comptroller Rule 3.344.,For SaaS Startup 
Q033,Tax,Do we need to register for sales tax nexus if we have remote employees in other states?,"If you employ remote workers, their presence usually creates physical nexus requiring sales-tax registration in that state, because an employee constitutes a substantial connection under Quill and reinforced by post-Wayfair guidance, so register promptly, collect tax, and file returns to avoid penalties; failure to register can trigger back taxes and personal liability for officers. Confirm each employee’s location and cross-check states’ rules.",Done,Reference Law: 26 U.S.C. § 6201; state nexus regulations such as N.J. Admin. Code 18:7-1.9.,For SaaS Startup 
Q034,Tax,How do I determine economic nexus thresholds for each state?,"Economic-nexus thresholds are determined by each state—commonly $100 000 in annual gross receipts or 200 separate transactions—so compare your prior- or current-year sales to each threshold and register once exceeded to comply with collection duties, because Wayfair authorized states to impose obligations without physical presence; companies often use automated dashboards to monitor thresholds monthly.",Done,Reference Law: S.D. Codified Laws §10-64-2 (the Wayfair model); similar statutes in most states.,For SaaS Startup 
Q035,Tax,What are the best practices for tracking sales tax liabilities across multiple states?,"Best practices for multi-state sales-tax tracking include using cloud tax engines that integrate with billing platforms, reconciling collected tax to liability accounts monthly, maintaining exemption certificates electronically, and scheduling calendar reminders for filing due dates, because automation reduces manual errors and ensures timely remittance; periodic nexus reviews and CPA SALT check-ups complete the control environment.",Done,"Reference Law: GAAP ASC 606 (principal/agent gross presentation); state record-keeping regulations, e.g., Cal. RTC §7053.",For SaaS Startup 
Q036,Tax,Can we claim the R&D tax credit for software development?,"Qualified software-development expenses can generally claim the federal R&D credit if they involve technological uncertainty, a systematic process, and aim for novel functionality or performance, allowing you to offset income tax (or up to $500 000 of payroll tax if in the five-year startup window), because IRC §41 rewards domestic innovation; keeping detailed project documentation and time tracking substantiates the claim.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §41; Reg. §1.41-4(a).,For SaaS Startup 
Q037,Tax,What expenses qualify for the federal R&D tax credit?,"Eligible R&D costs include U.S. wages for qualified development work, U.S. subcontractor fees (65 percent), supplies consumed in development, and certain cloud-computing costs used in experimentation, whereas general marketing or maintenance expenses do not qualify, so segregate labor and supply coding in your ERP for substantiation.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §41(b); Reg. §1.41-2.,For SaaS Startup

Q040,Tax,Do we need to issue 1099s for payments made through PayPal or Stripe?,"Payments processed through PayPal, Stripe, or other third-party networks are exempt from your 1099-NEC duty if the processor files a 1099-K, so review transaction statements and omit duplicative reporting; nonetheless, direct ACH or check payments still require your 1099-NEC issuance.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §6050W; IRS Pub 1220.,For SaaS Startup 
Q041,Tax,Are we required to file state franchise taxes even if we have no income?,"Many states levy a franchise- or margin-tax return even on zero-income entities, so file required reports to remain in good standing and avoid minimum-tax penalties; for example, Texas margins returns are due even with no tax due if revenue is under the threshold.",Done,Reference Law: Tex.

Q042,Tax,How do Delaware franchise taxes work for a C-corp?,"Delaware C-corps owe an annual franchise-tax and report calculated either on authorized shares or assumed par value, with a minimum $225 and due March 1; failure to pay leads to penalties and loss of good standing, jeopardizing future financings.",Done,"Reference Law: Del.

Q150,Bookkeeping,What’s the correct entry for applying a customer credit note?,"Applying a customer credit note involves debiting Sales Returns and Allowances (or Deferred Revenue if unearned) and crediting Accounts Receivable, reducing the customer’s balance and net revenue, ensuring revenue is stated net of concessions and collectible amounts.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 606-10-32-10 through 32-14,For SMBs
Q151,Tax,What business expenses are fully deductible on my tax return?,"Ordinary and necessary business expenses—such as rent, wages, advertising, software subscriptions, insurance, professional fees, office supplies, and routine repairs—are fully deductible because IRC §162 allows you to subtract costs that are common and helpful for earning income, thereby reducing taxable profit and matching cash outflow with revenue; make sure to keep contemporaneous receipts, segregate any personal portion, and capitalize items that create long-term benefits, yet facts can vary so professional confirmation is prudent.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §162; Reg. §1.162-1,For SMBs
Q152,Tax,Can I deduct meals and entertainment expenses?,"You may deduct 50 percent of qualifying business meals if the food is provided to a client or employee and business is discussed, while most entertainment expenses remain nondeductible since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the prior 50 percent allowance; careful contemporaneous documentation of date, place, participants, and business purpose is essential to withstand IRS scrutiny, and lavish or extravagant costs may still be challenged, so consult a CPA for edge cases.",Done,"Reference Law: IRC §274(k), §274(o); Notice 2021-25",For SMBs
Q153,Tax,Do I need to collect sales tax for online sales across state lines?,"After the Wayfair decision you generally must collect sales tax on interstate online sales once you exceed a state’s economic-nexus threshold, because states may impose collection duties without physical presence; failing to register and remit can trigger retroactive liability, penalties, and interest, so track revenue and transaction counts by jurisdiction and use a tax-automation platform to ensure correct rates and filings.",Done,"Reference Law: South Dakota v.

Q154,Tax,What’s the difference between an LLC and S-Corp for tax purposes?,"An LLC is a legal entity with default pass-through taxation—income flows to members and self-employment tax applies—whereas an S-Corp is an IRS tax election that also passes income through but allows reasonable wages plus distributive earnings exempt from self-employment tax; selecting S-status can lower payroll taxes and facilitate fringe-benefit deductions, but it imposes strict ownership rules, one share class, and formal payroll, so weigh administrative costs against tax savings.",Done,Reference Law: IRC Subchapters K (LLC default) and S (§1361-§1379),For SMBs
Q155,Tax,When should I file estimated tax payments?,"Quarterly estimated tax payments are due when you expect to owe at least $1,000 after withholding, and should be remitted by April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15 to avoid underpayment penalties, because IRC §6654 assesses interest on shortfalls; calculate each installment as 25 percent of the current-year liability or rely on the safe-harbor 100/110 percent prior-year rule, keeping state estimates aligned with their schedules.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §6654; Reg. §1.6654-2,For SMBs
Q156,Tax,How do I handle sales tax if I sell in multiple states?,"Selling in multiple states requires collecting the applicable rate once you meet each state’s nexus thresholds, filing separate returns, and sourcing sales based on destination, because most states use destination-based sourcing for tangible or digital goods; a unified tax engine, exemption-certificate management, and periodic nexus reviews minimize errors and audit exposure.",Done,Reference Law: Wayfair; Multistate Tax Commission guidance,For SMBs
Q157,Tax,Do I need to file state taxes even if I don’t operate in that state?,"State income-tax returns may be required even without in-state operations if your sales exceed economic-nexus thresholds or if the state assesses a franchise or gross-receipts tax on revenue sourced there, so monitor apportionment factors and register proactively to avoid surprise assessments, though P.L. 86-272 may protect pure solicitation of tangible goods.",Done,Reference Law: P.L. 86-272; individual state income-tax statutes,For SMBs
Q158,Tax,Can I deduct my home office if I sometimes work from home?,"A home-office deduction is allowed when a space is used exclusively and regularly as your principal place of business, letting you deduct a pro-rata share of rent, utilities, and other house costs (actual or simplified $5 per square foot up to 300 sq ft); documentation of floorplan and photos strengthens the claim and ties expenses to business use, but mixed-use rooms disqualify the space.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §280A(c)(1); Rev. Proc. 2013-13,For SMBs
Q159,Tax,How should I report cash income on my tax return?,"Report all cash income on Schedule C line 1 because the IRS treats unreported cash as taxable gross receipts, and reconciling bank deposits to sales records demonstrates completeness; failing to include cash can trigger penalties or criminal liability for underreporting, so accurate daily logs and point-of-sale Z-reports are essential evidence.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §61; Reg. §1.446-1,For SMBs
Q160,Tax,What forms do I need to file 1099s for my contractors?,"Issue Form 1099-NEC to each non-corporate U.S. contractor paid $600 or more during the year, filed with the IRS and sent to recipients by January 31, because IRC §6041 mandates reporting of service payments; collect Form W-9 upfront to capture proper tax IDs and avoid backup-withholding issues.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §6041; Reg. §1.6041-1,For SMBs
Q161,Tax,Are payroll taxes included in my quarterly estimated payments?,"Quarterly estimated payments generally exclude payroll taxes, which are deposited under separate pay-as-you-go schedules via EFTPS, so ensure both systems run in parallel: Form 941 deposits for FICA and withholding, plus Form 1040-ES for income and self-employment tax, preventing underpayment notices and trust-fund recovery penalties.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §6302; Treas.

Q163,Tax,Do I have to pay taxes on PPP loan forgiveness?,"Forgiven PPP loans are excluded from taxable income under the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021, and related otherwise-deductible expenses remain deductible, so no adjustment is needed on the return, but maintain forgiveness documentation in case of SBA or IRS review.",Done,Reference Law: CAA 2021 §276; IRC §1106(i) (CARES Act as amended),For SMBs
Q164,Tax,How can I reduce my self-employment taxes?,"Self-employment tax can be reduced by electing S-Corp status and paying a reasonable salary, maximizing deductible retirement contributions (SEP-IRA, Solo 401(k)), and ensuring eligible health-insurance premiums are taken as an above-the-line deduction, but aggressive salary minimization risks IRS reclassification, so balance savings with audit defensibility.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §1402; IRS Fact Sheet 2008-25,For SMBs

Q166,Tax,What are the tax implications of hiring family members?,"Hiring family members is permissible and wages are deductible if reasonable and actually paid, but you must issue payroll, withhold taxes, and remit employment taxes (exempting FUTA for child wages in parent-owned sole proprietorships); proper classification avoids recharacterization as disguised distributions.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §3121(b)(3); Pub 15 (Circular E),For SMBs
Q167,Tax,Do I need to charge sales tax on labor or services?,"Many states tax labor only when it is inseparable from tangible-goods sales, so pure professional or consulting services often escape sales tax, but digital services and SaaS may be taxable; verify each state’s statutes to avoid under-collection and update invoices accordingly.",Done,"Reference Law: state laws e.g., Texas Rule 3.330; New York TSB-M-11(16)S",For SMBs

Q172,Tax,Is it better to take a salary or distributions as the owner?,"Owners of S-Corps should draw reasonable W-2 salaries subject to payroll tax and take additional profits as distributions, because underpaying wages may trigger reclassification and penalties, whereas sole proprietors simply take draws that remain subject to self-employment tax.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §1366; IRS Fact Sheet 2008-25,For SMBs
Q173,Tax,Can I carry over net operating losses to future years?,"Net-operating losses generated after 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely and offset up to 80 percent of taxable income each year, providing a future tax shield, so track NOL schedules and attach detailed statements with each return; carrybacks are generally disallowed except for certain farming losses.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §172(a) and (b) as amended by TCJA,For SMBs
Q174,Tax,What tax credits are available to small businesses?,"Small-business tax credits include the R&D credit, work-opportunity credit, employer retirement-plan startup credit, and energy-efficiency incentives; evaluating eligibility annually can yield dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax, but documentation and timely elections (e.g., Form 5884) are essential for approval.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §38 general-business-credit framework,For SMBs
Q175,Tax,How do I calculate depreciation for tax purposes?,"MACRS depreciation uses prescribed class lives and tables—commonly five years for computers, seven for furniture—accelerating deductions compared with straight-line; electing Section 179 or bonus depreciation can further front-load cost recovery, but coordinate choices with state conformity to avoid mismatch.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §168; Rev.

Q176,Tax,Can I deduct business travel and lodging expenses?,"Travel and lodging for bona-fide business trips are fully deductible if the primary purpose is business and records show date, destination, and business rationale, while 50 percent meal limits still apply; mixed personal days require apportionment to preserve deductibility.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §162(a)(2); Reg. §1.162-2,For SMBs

Q184,closing,Should I close my books on a cash or accrual basis?,"Accrual accounting is preferred for closing because it aligns revenue with the period in which goods or services are delivered and expenses when incurred, providing a clear view of profitability and satisfying GAAP, whereas cash basis can mask receivables, payables, and liabilities, so cash statements may be maintained only for tax filings if allowed.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 105-10; IRC §448,For SMBs
Q185,closing,How do I handle outstanding invoices during closing?,"Outstanding customer invoices should be aged, confirmed with customers if overdue, and reclassified to an allowance if doubtful, because receivables must reflect net realizable value; this practice maintains accurate revenue recognition and signals collection issues early, aiding cash-flow planning.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 326-20,For SMBs

Q211,Client Advisory,How can I improve my cash flow management?,"Improve cash flow by speeding receivables, negotiating longer payables, and forecasting weekly inflows and outflows, because liquidity—not paper profit—keeps operations running and GAAP’s accrual statements can mask timing gaps; adopting electronic invoicing, early-pay discounts, and rolling 13-week cash projections provides visibility and control, yet assumptions must be revisited monthly to stay accurate.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 230 (statement of cash flows),For SMBs
Q212,Client Advisory,Should I convert from an LLC to an S-Corp for tax savings?,"Converting from an LLC to an S-Corp can save self-employment tax by splitting income between reasonable payroll (subject to FICA) and distributions (exempt), because IRC §1361 allows pass-through treatment while wages satisfy compensation rules; weigh the savings against added payroll costs, S-Corp eligibility limits, and state tax nuances before electing on Form 2553.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §§ 1361-1378; Rev.

Q214,Client Advisory,How much should I set aside for taxes each quarter?,"Set aside at least 25–30 percent of net profit for quarterly federal and state taxes, because pass-through owners owe both income and self-employment tax and IRC §6654 penalizes under-withholding; refine the percentage once an annualized projection is prepared each quarter.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §6654,For SMBs
Q215,Client Advisory,Can you help me create a financial forecast?,"A three-statement financial forecast built on revenue drivers, cost behavior, and working-capital cycles gives management and lenders visibility, because the integrated model shows how GAAP earnings translate into cash and covenant ratios; revisiting it quarterly aligns expectations with actual results.",Done,Reference Law: ASC 205 (full set of financials),For SMBs

Q217,Client Advisory,Should I hire full-time employees or keep using contractors?,"Use contractors when demand is project-based or specialized, and hire employees when work is continuous and core, because IRS common-law tests classify control and misclassification triggers payroll-tax exposure; a blended model can optimize flexibility and cost if roles are clearly documented.",Done,Reference Law: IRC §3121(d); IRS Pub 15-A,For SMBs
